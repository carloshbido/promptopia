## Description

This web app was developed in reference to the JsMastery channel video. The main purpose of developing this app was to practice the new version 13.4 of NextJs and also to practice MongoDb, as I don't work with that database on a daily basis =).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

```
It's important create env variables to handle with MongoDb and Google API OAuth
